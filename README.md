mkdir %userprofile%\Desktop\DocBackup
copy %userprofile%\Documents\*.docx %userprofile%\Desktop\DocBackup
echo Backup completed successfully!
```
Modify the script to delete files with the ".docx" extension from the "Documents" folder after creating the backup.
```
@echo off
mkdir %userprofile%\Desktop\DocBackup
copy %userprofile%\Documents\*.docx %userprofile%\Desktop\DocBackup
del %userprofile%\Documents\*.docx
